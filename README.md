## Overview

Scribble is a novel framework for high-performance computing that simulates crystal lattice structures for complex calculations. By modeling computational problems as crystal lattice interactions, we achieve efficient parallel processing and unique optimization opportunities. While inspired by quantum computing principles, Scribble focuses on practical, classical computing applications using crystal lattice simulations.

## Core Components

### 1. Crystal Navigation (Zeronaut)
- Efficient pathfinding through simulated crystal structures
- Energy field optimization for computation
- Phase-space navigation algorithms
- Parallel computation mapping

### 2. State Observation (Phantom)
- Non-destructive state monitoring in crystal simulations
- Real-time coherence analysis
- Pattern recognition in crystal lattices
- Performance optimization through state tracking

### 3. State Storage (Scribe)
- High-performance data storage using crystal lattice patterns
- Efficient state encoding and retrieval
- Error detection and correction
- Multi-layered data representation

### 4. Mathematical Foundation (MeshMath)
- Crystalline structure mathematics
- Field calculations and optimizations
- Phase-space transformations
- Performance-focused algorithms

## Technical Requirements

- Rust (nightly)
- No standard library dependencies (no_std)
- SIMD support for crystal field simulations
- 64-bit architecture recommended

## Note on Quantum Computing

While Scribble's design is inspired by quantum computing concepts, it is primarily a classical computing framework that simulates crystal lattice patterns for high-performance computing applications. The quantum-like behaviors are simulated for optimization purposes and do not require quantum hardware.
