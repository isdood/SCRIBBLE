## Overview
Scribble is a custom kernel and operating system written in Rust, featuring an advanced storage system that simulates quantum and relativistic principles on standard hardware. The project combines traditional OS functionality with innovative storage mechanisms for efficient data management and retrieval.

## Project Components

### Boot System
- `spinUP`: Primary bootloader (no_std)
- `spINIT`: System initialization
- `spun`: Boot sequence manager

### Core Libraries
- `scribble`: Core kernel and OS functionality
- `unstable_matter`: Advanced storage system implementation

## Storage System Features

### Vector Operations
- `Vector3D`: Efficient 3D spatial operations
- `Vector4D`: Spacetime-inspired 4D vector implementation
- Custom metric calculations for optimal data placement
- Advanced spatial indexing

### Data Management
- Multi-dimensional memory mapping
- Advanced caching system with temporal optimization
- Data integrity verification
- Compression optimization
- Parallel access pathways

### Storage Architecture
- Simulated quantum-inspired state management
- High-density data compression
- Near-instantaneous retrieval system
- Pattern-based data organization
- Integrity monitoring and verification

## Core Components

### Vector System (`vector.rs`)
- Spatial and temporal vector operations
- Custom metric calculations
- Optimization for standard hardware
- Multi-dimensional mapping support

### UFO System (`ufo.rs`)
- Unified File Operations
- Asynchronous I/O handling
- Advanced pattern matching for file operations
- Stream-based data processing
- Custom file descriptor management
- Parallel operation coordination

### Mesh Clock (`mesh_clock.rs`)
- Distributed timing system
- Network time synchronization
- Event ordering and scheduling
- Temporal dependency tracking
- Clock drift compensation
- Multi-node time coordination

## Recent Updates (2025-01-14)
- Implemented Vector4D operations
- Enhanced UFO system reliability
- Improved mesh clock synchronization
- Added verification layer
- Updated cache management

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```rust
use unstable_matter::{Vector4D, UFOSystem, MeshClock};

// Initialize core systems
let ufo = UFOSystem::new();
let clock = MeshClock::new();

// Configure UFO parameters
let ufo_config = UFOConfig::new()
    .with_async(true)
    .with_verification(true);

// Handle file operations
let file_id = ufo.process_file(data, ufo_config)?;
let timestamp = clock.get_synchronized_time();
