## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```rust
use unstable_matter::{Vector4D, UFOSystem, MeshClock};

// Initialize core systems
let ufo = UFOSystem::new();
let clock = MeshClock::new(
    Vector3D::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    1.0
);

// Configure UFO parameters
let ufo_config = UFOConfig::new()
    .with_async(true)
    .with_verification(true)
    .with_quantum_trace(true);

// Handle file operations with quantum awareness
let file_id = ufo.process_file(data, ufo_config)?;
let quantum_state = clock.get_quantum_state();
let coherence = clock.get_pattern_coherence()?;

// Quantum pattern transfer
if let Ok(()) = clock.transfer_quantum_pattern() {
    println!("Pattern coherence: {:.2}", coherence);
    println!("Quantum state: {:?}", quantum_state);
}
