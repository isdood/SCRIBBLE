## Overview
Scribble is a memory management and alignment toolkit designed for low-level systems programming. It provides safe abstractions for memory operations while maintaining precise control over memory layout.

## Project Structure

### 1. Unstable Matter (`lib/unstable_matter/`)
Core library providing fundamental types and operations:
- `Vector3D`: 3D vector operations
- `UFO`: Memory tracking and protection
- `SpaceTime`: Memory space-time operations
- `MorphTracker`: File type morphing and tracking
- `Alignment`: Memory alignment utilities (formerly in Scribble)
- `MeshClock`: Quantum pattern transfer system (New)

Key Features:
- No-std compatible
- Atomic operations for thread safety
- Memory protection through UFO tracking
- Precise timestamp tracking for all operations
- Quantum pattern transfer without observation (New)
- Protected quantum states with coherence preservation (New)
- Non-collapsing state replication (New)

### Quantum Pattern Transfer System (MeshClock)
The MeshClock system enables replication of quantum states through data pattern copying, avoiding wave function collapse through non-observational transfers:

- **QuantumDataPattern**: Struct for holding quantum patterns with aligned memory.
  - `mesh_shape`: Fixed size array for quantum patterns.
  - `quantum_signature`: Unique identifier for quantum states.
  - `pattern_coherence`: Coherence level of the quantum pattern.
  - `timestamp`: Atomic timestamp for tracking changes.
  - `alignment`: Memory alignment configuration.

- **ProtectedQuantumState**: Manages the internal quantum state with observation tracking.
  - `internal_state`: Option container for quantum data.
  - `observation_count`: Atomic counter for observations.
  - Methods:
    - `observe`: Observes the quantum state, reducing coherence.
    - `transfer_pattern`: Transfers the quantum pattern without observation.
    - `update_from_pattern`: Updates the state from a transferred pattern.

- **MeshCell**: Represents a cell in the quantum mesh with position and state.
  - `position`: 3D position of the cell.
  - `state`: Current state of the cell.
  - `quantum_signature`: Unique identifier for the cell.
  - `region`: Aligned memory region.
  - Methods:
    - `new`: Constructs a new MeshCell.
    - Implements `QuantumPattern` for updating quantum pattern.

- **MeshClock**: Manages the entire quantum mesh clock system.
  - `alpha_cell`, `omega_cell`: The main cells in the mesh.
  - `signal_vector`: Vector representing signal direction.
  - `last_ping`, `oscillation_count`, `measured_interval`: Atomic counters for tracking events.
  - `quantum_state`: Current quantum state.
  - `entanglement_strength`: Strength of quantum entanglement.
  - `pattern_buffer`: Buffer for holding quantum patterns.
  - `alignment`: Memory alignment configuration.
  - Methods:
    - `new`: Constructs a new MeshClock.
    - `calculate_time_dilation`: Computes time dilation effects.
    - `transfer_quantum_pattern`: Transfers quantum patterns.
    - `replicate_pattern`: Replicates the quantum pattern.
    - `get_pattern_coherence`: Retrieves the coherence of the pattern.
    - `entangle_cells`: Entangles the alpha and omega cells.
    - `create_superposition`: Creates a superposition state.
    - `ping`, `pong`: Manages signal propagation.
    - `get_frequency`: Gets the frequency of oscillation.
    - `get_quantum_state`, `get_entanglement_strength`: Retrieves quantum state and strength.
    - `sync_with_rtc`, `calibrate`: Synchronizes and calibrates the mesh clock.
    - `generate_quantum_signature`: Generates a unique quantum signature.
