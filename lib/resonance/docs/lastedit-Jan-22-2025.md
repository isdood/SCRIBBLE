# Resonance Project Status Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-23 04:52:04 UTC
**Developer:** isdood

## Project Overview
Successfully set up a multi-language computational library (Resonance) that integrates:
- Julia (for numerical computations)
- Rust (for system integration)
- Zig (for low-level operations)

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. Julia Component âœ…
Located in: `src/julia/`
```
src/julia/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Resonance.jl      # Main module implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ runtests.jl       # Test suite
â””â”€â”€ Project.toml          # Package dependencies
```

**Key Features:**
- `CrystalStructure` and `HarmonyField` data structures
- Harmony computation using differential equations
- Integration with CUDA for potential GPU acceleration

**Dependencies:**
- DifferentialEquations
- CUDA
- LinearAlgebra
- Statistics

**Working Example:**
```julia
using Resonance

# Create test crystal
lattice = rand(8, 8, 8)
harmony_field = complex.(rand(8, 8, 8))
crystal = CrystalStructure(lattice, harmony_field, 0.618)

# Compute harmony
result = compute_harmony(crystal)
# Last run results:
# Harmony level: 0.713
# Whimsy factor: 0.338
```

### 2. Rust Component ðŸ”„
Located in: `src/rust/`
```
src/rust/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”œâ”€â”€ harmony/
â””â”€â”€ crystals/
```
Basic structure implemented with module scaffolding.

### 3. Zig Component ðŸ”„
Located in: `src/zig/`
Basic structure with main initialization.

## Build System
- Julia package properly initialized and working
- Rust crate integrated into workspace
- Zig build system configured

## Next Steps
1. **Julia Component:**
   - Add visualization capabilities
   - Implement more crystal pattern types
   - Add benchmarking suite

2. **Rust Component:**
   - Implement FFI bindings to Julia
   - Complete core functionality
   - Add error handling

3. **Zig Component:**
   - Implement low-level optimizations
   - Add Julia runtime integration
   - Create performance-critical routines

## Current Results
Initial tests show successful:
- Crystal field generation
- Harmony computation
- Basic integration between components

## To Resume Development
1. Navigate to project:
   ```bash
   cd ~/scribble/scribble/lib/resonance
   ```

2. Activate Julia environment:
   ```bash
   cd src/julia
   julia --project=.
   ```

3. Run example:
   ```julia
   using Resonance
   include("../../examples/harmony_example.jl")
   ```

## Notes
- Julia component is fully functional
- Need to complete Rust and Zig integration
- Current focus should be on completing the FFI layer between components

All changes are tracked in the repository, with the latest working version committed and tested.
