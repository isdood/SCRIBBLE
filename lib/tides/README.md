# Tides 🌊

> Crystal-based wave computing framework powered by harmonic resonance

## Overview

Tides is a high-performance wave computation framework that leverages crystal lattice structures for advanced processing. By combining Rust's reliability, Zig's performance, Julia's resonance processing, and Chapel's wave distribution capabilities, Tides provides a unique approach to crystal-based computing.

## Features

- 🎯 **Crystal Lattice Core**: Advanced wave pattern processing through crystalline structures
- 🌟 **Harmonic Resonance**: Julia-powered resonance calculations for complex wave interactions
- 🔄 **Wave Distribution**: Chapel-based distributed wave pattern management
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Zig-optimized core operations for crystal-critical computations
- 🛠️ **Flexible Integration**: Seamless integration with existing wave processing systems

## Quick Start

```rust
use tides::{WavePattern, CrystalState, Resonator};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the wave pattern
    let mut wave = WavePattern::new()?;
    
    // Create a resonant crystal state
    let crystal = CrystalState::with_frequency(440.0)?;
    
    // Process wave through crystal lattice
    wave.flow_through(&crystal)?;
    
    // Achieve harmonic resonance
    let resonance = Resonator::new()
        .with_wave(wave)
        .achieve_harmony()?;
        
    println!("Harmony achieved: {:.2}Hz", resonance.frequency());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Installation

Add Tides to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tides = "0.1"
```

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- Zig 0.11+

## Architecture

Tides is built on four main pillars:

1. **Core Wave System** (Rust)
   - Wave pattern management
   - Crystal state coordination
   - Harmony orchestration

2. **Resonance Processing** (Julia)
   - Complex wave calculations
   - Harmonic pattern analysis
   - Resonance optimization

3. **Wave Distribution** (Chapel)
