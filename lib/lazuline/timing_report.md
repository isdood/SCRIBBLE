## Test Summary
- âœ… All tests passed
- Total test suites: 4
  1. Crystal Channel Multi-threaded Operations
  2. Crystal Timer Precision and Drift
  3. Harmonic Mutex Wave Patterns
  4. Harmonic Async Wave Functions

## Performance Metrics
### Timer Precision
- Base precision: 1,000,000 ns (1ms)
- Measured drift tolerance: 3x precision
- Crystal frequencies tested:
  - 32,768 Hz (standard crystal oscillator)
  - 100,000 Hz (high-precision mode)

### Channel Performance
- Buffer size: 64 messages
- Resonance frequency: 440 Hz (A440)
- Damping factor: 0.01

### Thread Safety
- Mutex contention test: 400 operations
- Thread count: 4
- Operations per thread: 100
- All operations completed successfully

## Next Steps
1. Add long-term stability tests
2. Implement temperature compensation calibration
3. Add performance benchmarks for various message sizes
4. Document API and usage examples

## Recent Changes
- Fixed timer precision handling
- Improved sleep duration accuracy
- Added system scheduling compensation
- Updated test suite with proper measurements
- Implemented proper error handling

Would you like me to:
1. Add more comprehensive benchmarks?
2. Implement the long-term stability tests?
3. Create API documentation?
4. Add temperature compensation calibration?
