echo "âœ¨ Fast mode optimizations updated successfully!

Key improvements:
1. Added workspace resolver = \"2\"
2. Fixed edition compatibility
3. Maintained optimization settings
4. Clean benchmark configuration
5. Updated timestamps

Run benchmarks:
cd lib/rust && RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo bench
