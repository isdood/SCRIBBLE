*Author: isdood*

## Current Status

We have successfully:
1. Fixed workspace configuration issues
2. Added missing num-traits dependency
3. Optimized performance with LTO
4. Completed comprehensive performance benchmarking
5. Created detailed documentation and README

## Latest Benchmark Results
- Quantum gates showing strong performance (16-482ns range)
- Lattice operations optimized (particularly tetragonal/hexagonal ~16-27ns)
- Full benchmark suite implemented and running

## Current Implementation
- Using full LTO optimization
- SIMD optimizations in place for lattice operations
- Pre-allocated buffers for performance
- Workspace properly configured

## Files Updated
1. `Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies and optimization settings
2. `src/lattice/operations.rs` - SIMD optimizations
3. `src/lattice/group.rs` - Group operation improvements
4. `README.md` - Complete documentation with benchmarks
5. Root workspace configuration

## Next Steps To Consider
1. Investigate cubic lattice performance improvement (currently ~612ns for 256 elements)
2. Reduce operation variance (currently 5-15% outliers)
3. Optimize group operation overhead
4. Consider GPU acceleration implementation
5. Add distributed computing support

## Build Command
```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native -C opt-level=3' cargo build --release
```

## Benchmark Command
```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo bench
```

## Repository State
- All tests passing
- Benchmarks running successfully
- Documentation up to date
- Performance metrics documented

## Development Environment
- Location: /home/guavabot1/scribble/scribble/lib/zigzag
- Workspace: Part of scribble workspace

This update was written at the end of a session focused on performance optimization and documentation. The codebase is in a stable state with comprehensive benchmarking results and documentation in place.
