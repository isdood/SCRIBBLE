# BraggCache Optimization Summary

## Current Performance Metrics (as of 03:39:38 UTC)
```
Cache Statistics:
- Initial Storage: 753 vectors
- Hit Rate: 24.7% (first pass) → 62.35% (second pass)
- Miss Rate: Constant at 753 misses
- Processing Speed: ~2.7ms per 1000 vectors
  - Min: 2.635-2.660ms
  - Max: 2.784-3.323ms
  - Mean: 2.703-2.766ms
```

## Today's Improvements

1. **Memory Safety**
   - Added GPA safety checks
   - Implemented proper memory pre-allocation
   - Added bounds checking
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **Numeric Stability**
   - Added NaN/Inf validation
   - Improved floating-point comparisons
   - Added epsilon-based equality checks
   - Enhanced vector validation

3. **Cache Structure**
   - Implemented spatial hashing (grid size 0.01)
   - Added octant-based clustering
   - Improved neighbor tracking
   - Enhanced hit rate tracking

4. **Benchmark Framework**
   - Added detailed diagnostics
   - Implemented warmup phase
   - Added performance metrics
   - Enhanced error reporting

## Current Implementation Details
```zig
// Key Constants
const EPSILON = 1e-10;
const GRID_SIZE = 0.01;
const BENCH_ITERATIONS = 10;
const VECTORS_PER_ITERATION = 1000;
const WARMUP_ITERATIONS = 2;
```

## Identified Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Cache Hit Rate**
   - Current grid size might be too fine
   - Consider adaptive grid sizing
   - Potential for better clustering

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Pre-allocation can be optimized
   - Buffer sizes can be tuned
   - Memory layout could be improved

3. **Performance**
   - Hash function could be optimized
   - Vector comparison could be faster
   - Cluster assignment could be more efficient

## Next Steps Suggested

1. Optimize grid size (increase to 0.025)
2. Tune pre-allocation to match usage (≈800)
3. Implement adaptive clustering
4. Add performance profiling
